  - title: Controllable synthesis and performance test of high-mobility III-V nanowires
    company: Instructed by Professor. Zai-xing Yang
    company_url: ''
    location: Shandong University
    date_start: '2021-09-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        
        * Synthesized n-channel nanowires (InP) with high electron mobility and p-channel nanowires (GaSb) with high hole mobility by controllable vapor-solid-solid growth mode of CVD.
        * Studied in electrical and photoelectric properties of III-V nanowires (GaSb, InP) by using Semiconductor Device Analyzer and probe station.
        * Read masses of papers with regard to the III-V nanowires and participated weekly group meetings.
        * Working on the project now with Postdoc and PhD students.
