  - title: Construction of TMDs-GP/BN potentials via Deep Potential Molecular Dynamic method 
    company: Instructed by Professor. Quansheng Wu
    company_url: ''
    location: Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science
    date_start: '2022-09-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
     
        * Developing molecular dynamics potentials of 2D systems (TMDs-Graphene, TMDs-hBN) as accurate as the DFT via Deep Potentials Molecular Dynamics.
        * Working on the project now and participating in weekly group meetings.
       
 - title: Novel polymer-free assembly method of 2D systems under ultra-high vacuum
    company: Instructed by Professor. Yuanbo Zhang
    company_url: ''

    date_end: '2022-08-01'
    description: |2-
     
        * Developed a polymer-free process to pick up and assemble 2D materials (h-BN) using 300nm and 500nm 〖Si〗_3 N_4 thin film cantilevers coated with metals (2nm Cr,6nm Au) under ultra-high vacuum.
        * Designed a fixture for fixing the polymer-free pick-up tools via solid work.
        * Presented individual internship report entitled “Polymer-free Assembly of 2D Systems under Ultra-high Vacuum” in the final seminar.

    company_url: ''
    location: Shandong University
    date_start: '2021-09-01'
    date_end: 'P2022-06-01'
    description: |2-
        
        * Synthesized Core-Shell III-V nanowires (GaSb@SnS2, GaAs@GeS2) with high aspect ratio and uniform shell thickness by controllable vapor-solid-solid growth mode of CVD.
        *	Discovered novel negative photoresponse which can enhance the photocurrent in near-infrared range (1310nm, 1550nm) of Core-Shell III-V nanowires (GaSb@SnS2, GaAs@GeS2) in visible wavelengths (405nm, 520nm) by using Semiconductor Device Analyzer and semiconductor laser.
        * Read masses of papers with regard to the III-V nanowires and participated in weekly group meetings.
        
  - title: Design and development of a multifunctional passive filter for test circuits of 2D systems
    company: Instructed by Professor. Zhe Wang
    company_url: ''
    location: Xi'an jiaotong University
    date_start: '2021-07-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-31'
    description: |2-
     
        * Designed a kind of passive filter capable of adjusting cutoff frequency and passband range (1Hz, 100Hz and 1000Hz).
        * Used the required components to weld the circuit according to the designed and simulated circuit diagram. (Three same multifunctional passive filters have been successfully fabricated and the performance is good.)
        * Presented individual research report entitled "Multifunctional Passive Filter" in group meeting.
        * Learned laboratory operations of 2D quantum materials and devices, prepared two-dimensional materials (graphene and hNB) with tapes, combined them into hNB-graphene-hNB structures under high power microscopy, and tested the properties of samples.
