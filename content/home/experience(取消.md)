  - title: Novel polymer-free assembly method of 2D systems under ultra-high vacuum
    company: Instructed by Professor. Yuanbo Zhang
    company_url: ''
    location: Fudan University
    date_start: '2022-07-01'
    date_end: '2022-08-01'
    description: |2-
     
        * Developed a polymer-free process to pick up and assemble 2D materials (h-BN) using 300nm and 500nm Si3N4 thin film cantilevers coated with metals (2nm Cr,6nm Au) under ultra-high vacuum.
        * Designed a fixture for fixing the polymer-free pick-up tools via solid work.
        * Presented individual internJship report entitled “Polymer-free Assembly of 2D Systems under Ultra-high Vacuum” in the final seminar.
