## Welcome to my website!

I built my [old website](https://shangyiguo.mysxl.cn) last semester by sxl which is a tool used to build web without codes. However, there were many problems and limitations when I built it without codes.

After learning C and Python, I have had a better understanding of codes and programme.Therefore, I use Github to build this one recently.

Welcome once again!
