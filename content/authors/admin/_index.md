I am an undergraduate student in SDU, keening on Condensed Matter Physics. My research focuses on understanding electronic and quantum properties of 2D systems by nano-device fabrication and electronic transport measurements and controllable synthesis and performance investigation of III-V nanowires semiconductor nanostructures for optoelectronic device applications.

I am also interested in first principles calculations of novel quantum phenomena in Condensed Matters.
